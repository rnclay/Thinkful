    "**The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to use the **\"Anger\"** slogan may have been premature. There were two groups and two speakers, but each group only heard one slogan, from one speaker. As a result, we can't accurately assess if the **\"Anger\"** slogan is better or if Palpatine is a better speaker (*He was definitely more eloquent in the movies*). Also, there is no indication the two Droid groups were assessed for **\"pro\"** or **\"anti\"** Sith sentiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would correct this by first combining the two Droid groups into one large group and then ***randomly*** dividing them into ***four*** smaller groups, the groups would be kept separate. I would then attempt to establish if any of the groups possessed very skewed **\"pro\"** or **\"anti\"** sentiment toward the Sith. \n",
    "\n",
    "These new groups would hear each slogan twice, once from Lord Vader, and once from Emperor Palpatine. We are increasing the number of times the Droids are subjected to Sith slogans, and we need to try and mitigate **recruitment by nagging**. So, two of the groups will hear the **\"Anger\"** slogan first, each with different speakers, and two groups will hear the **\"Together\"** slogan first, each with different speakers. This could help us determine whether the effectiveness of either slogan was due to slogan bombardment versus genuine inspiration. \n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the effectiveness converters would be counted after each slogan hearing. The slogan with the highest conversion rate is likely the best slogan. You would also have data on slogan order that you could evaluate for deeper insights.\n",

    "**In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment does not appear to have ***defined*** success, or put controls in place to properly ***measure*** whether or not success was achieved. These oversights appear to make the selection of Jar Jar as ambassador premature. The decision makers appear to be relying on feedback from their to envoys, not on collected data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to address this I would request the decision makers to sit down and explicitly define ***\"success\"*** in regards to public relations. If that turns out to be more than one thing, I would request the decision makers to rank the successes in order of desirability. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the successes were defined, I would request the Jedi data scientist design questionnaires to assess whether or not those successes were achieved. I would then send the Jedi data scientist ***with*** Jar Jar and Wince to handle data collection and evaluation in an objective way. The decision makers should still collect feedback from Jar Jar and Wince, but that should be only be a *part* of their process. The decision, in large part, should be based on what the data science gleaned from the data. \n"

    "It **could** be true that the company's app is encouraging increased activity, but a steady rise in activity levels among wearers doesn't *necessarily* indicate it's due to the app. It is possible that a large portion of the app's installers were ***already*** high activity indivduals and wanted a way to track their activities. It's also possible that the app's installers planned a goal that required lots of exercise i.e. (marathon, triathlon, century ride) and got the app to track their training progress.\n",

There is also a scale question in their statement ***that people's activity levels rise steadily***, is that compared to zero, which is what the app knows about the individual before the individual consents to share their data, and is that *'rise'* perpetual? Also, this is an \"***opt in\"*** endeavor, it would be prudent to investigate the differences between those that ***opt out*** and those that ***opt in***. \n",
