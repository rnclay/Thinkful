In data science, this is an example of the so-called recommendations systems. Read this nontechnical blog post of Netflix about how they model their recommendations systems. Then, derive the features they use in their recommendations engines and discuss what else can be incorporated into this model.\n",

From left to right the differences between the viewers viewing profile and the suggested shows would **decrease** as you move right (-- unless you have selected Arabic or Hebrew as your language in our systems, in which case these will go right to left). ;) \n"
